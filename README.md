# Members Club

- This program can register members of a club with a set of attributes such as name address and the like.
- Each member of the club has a specific membership role, Manager, Junior, Beginner, Officer, etc.
- All members are related to each other somehow, hence a subscriber class holds all attributes.
- Each subclass extends Subscriber.
- The program can sort the members alphabetically, shows an ordered list of members who didn't pay.
- It also prints a report of all members given any of their attributes.
- The program is built on a stack data structure, in particular,a stack of arrays to contain strings, boolean and integer values.
